#  Event Management System API üöÄ

Welcome to the **Event Management System**, a robust and secure backend API built with **Spring Boot**. This project provides a complete solution for managing events, allowing customers to register and manage their events, and organizers to oversee all activities on the platform.



---

## ‚ú® Key Features

This API is divided into two main roles, each with a specific set of permissions and capabilities:

### ü§µ **For Customers**
-   **User Authentication**: Secure registration and JWT-based login.
-   **Event Creation**: Customers can register new events with all necessary details.
-   **Event Management**: Easily view, update, and modify event details.
-   **Event Cancellation**: Ability to cancel an event with a specified reason.

### üëë **For Organizers**
-   **Full Access Control**: Organizers can view all events and customer details on the platform.
-   **Customer Management**: Block or unblock customers from booking new events.
-   **Event Oversight**: Organizers have the authority to cancel any event if necessary.
-   **Secure Endpoints & Graceful Error Handling**: All organizer actions are protected, and the API provides clear, consistent error responses.

## üèõÔ∏è Project Structure

The project follows a standard layered architecture to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability.

-   **`config`**: Contains security configurations, including JWT filters.
-   **`controller`**: Handles all incoming HTTP requests and API endpoints.
-   **`dto`**: (Data Transfer Objects) - Used to shape the data for API responses and requests, preventing direct exposure of entity models.
-   **`exception`**: Includes a global exception handler to manage errors gracefully across the application.
-   **`model`**: Defines the JPA entities that map to database tables.
-   **`repository`**: Contains the Spring Data JPA interfaces for database operations.
-   **`service`**: Implements the core business logic of the application.

## üîë API Endpoints

Here is a summary of the available API endpoints. All operational endpoints require a valid JWT token for authorization.

### **Authentication (`/api/auth`)**
| Method | Endpoint                       | Description                  |
| :----- | :----------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/register/customer`           | Registers a new customer.    |

| `POST` | `/login`                       | Logs in a user and returns a JWT. |

### **Customer Actions (`/api/customer`)**

| :------- | :----------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| `POST`     | `/events/register`             | Creates a new event.         |
| `GET`      | `/events/{eventId}`            | Retrieves event details.     |
| `PUT`      | `/events/{eventId}`            | Updates an existing event.   |
| `DELETE`   | `/events/{eventId}`            | Cancels an event.            |

### **Organizer Actions (`/api/organizer`)**
| Method | Endpoint                       | Description                  |
| :----- | :----------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/events`                      | Gets a list of all events.   |
| `GET`    | `/customers`                   | Gets a list of all customers.|
| `PUT`    | `/customers/{customerId}/block`| Blocks a customer.           |
| `PUT`    | `/customers/{customerId}/unblock`| Unblocks a customer.       |
| `DELETE` | `/events/{eventId}`            | Cancels any event.           |
